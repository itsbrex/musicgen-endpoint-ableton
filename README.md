# ðŸŽ¶ðŸŒˆ MetaAI Musicgen â€” AWS Endpoint + Ableton integration

This repository implements [Musicgen](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft), 
a state of the art text-to-music model, as a scalable online endpoint in AWS Sagemaker. 
It includes a lambda function to enable public access to the endpoint, as well as a 
[Max4Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/) device that allows to 
perform inference right within Ableton Live, seamlessly integrating the model into 
any music production workflow. 

Check out the demo below! Audio on! ðŸ”ŠðŸ”½
